Disaster Database along China–Laos Kunming–Vientiane Railway (DD-CLKV-Rail)

# Introduction
The disaster point data collected in this project were obtained from Yunnan Province Geological Hazard Detailed Investigation Data, EM-DAT - The international disaster database (emdat.be) and Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) compiled by NASA. A total of 2,442 geohazard investigation point data were collected, dividing the China-Laos Railway into two parts, the Chinese section and the Laos section, of which 1,218 are in the Chinese section and 1,224 are in the Laos section, and the types of geohazards include landslides, mudslides, earthquakes, avalanches, ground collapses, ground subsidence and ground cracks. The dataset includes information on the types of geohazards, geographic locations, information sources, and threat ranges. The dataset is stored in .shp and .xls formats and consists of 24 files with a data size of 11.5 MB.

# Background of dataset research
Geological hazards refer to the geological effects that cause losses and damage to human life, property and the environment due to the influence of natural or man-made factors, and commonly include avalanches, landslides and so on. Geological disasters are more sudden and have many influencing factors, and many uncertain factors are difficult to forecast. In recent years, although China has established a disaster prevention and mitigation system, the situation of geologic disaster prevention and control is still relatively severe. In the face of such phenomena, geologic disaster risk measurement is a research topic of great practical significance. The research results can provide a reference basis for government departments to organize disaster prevention and mitigation work, urban construction planning and financial expenditure arrangements.
The “China-Laos Railway”, a large steel artery, passes through the mountainous areas of southern Yunnan and northern Laos, with high mountains and deep valleys, special topography and geomorphology along the way, crossing many mountain ranges and water systems, with complex geological structures, large differences in climatic conditions, harsh natural conditions, high geothermal heat, high geostress, high seismicity, and active neotectonic movements, active geothermal water environment, and active exotropic environment, which are the main factors for the development of the railway. The region is characterized by high geothermal heat, high geostress, high seismic intensity, active neotectonic movement, active geothermal water environment, active exo-dynamic geological conditions, and active process of shallow reformation of bank slopes, and therefore the region is the region with frequent occurrence of landslides, avalanches, mudslides, and other geologic hazards, and the most serious human casualties and property losses in the world.

# Overview of Disaster Database along China–Laos Kunming–Vientiane Railway (DD-CLKV-Rail)
Based on the China-Laos Railway Alignment—Geologic Disaster—POI—Data, Administrative divisions along the China-Laos Railway and prior knowledge dataset, the distribution map of Geologic Disaster along railroads is generated,  as shown in the figure below:
